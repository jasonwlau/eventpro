There's another readme inside the treact file for how to run, if on WIndows and it keeps breaking, 
run 
### `npm install styled-components --save`
### `npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-styled-components`

Otherwise, change into treact directory, then src, and then
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Lastly, the application needs to be running on port 3000 due to making cors requests at the moment, so please kill any processes running on that port before running this.
